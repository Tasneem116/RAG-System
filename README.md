#RAG Project

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for question-answering tasks using OpenAI's GPT-4 and Elasticsearch. The code loads documents, splits them into chunks, stores them in an Elasticsearch index, and retrieves relevant context to answer user queries.
